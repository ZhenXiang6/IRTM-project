French President Emmanuel Macronwelcomed world leadersto Paris on Saturday, December 7, for the spectacular reopening ceremony ofNotre Damecathedral, five years after a devastating inferno engulfed the landmark.
The inaugural Mass took place on Sunday, December 8, and the cathedral reopened to the public.
Many will remember watching in horror in 2019 as bright orangeflames swallowed the 860-year-old Gothic cathedral, huge plumes of smoke billowing into the sky as its famed spire toppled from the Paris skyline.
At the time, Macron vowed the charred remains would be restored and set an ambitious deadline of five years. Fast forward just over 2,000 days and the seemingly impossible has been achieved.
Thousands of artisans, engineers, carpenters and other craftspeople came together to resurrect the beloved UNESCO world heritage site. The limestone walls have been methodically cleaned, while numerous other architectural elements andcenturies-old relicsmeticulously restored.
