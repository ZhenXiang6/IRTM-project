In a case that’s horrified France and shocked the world, 48 men were convicted of raping Gisele Pelicot after her husband, Dominique Pelicot, drugged her repeatedly and left her unconscious. The abuse took place over nearly 10 years. CNN has gained exclusive access to a police report containing thousands of messages exchanged by Pelicot and the these men in chatrooms, on Skype and over text, revealing how the crimes happened. While the website that Pelicot used to organize the abuse has been shut down, a CNN investigation has uncovered new forums where rape and sexual abuse are still actively discussed.
