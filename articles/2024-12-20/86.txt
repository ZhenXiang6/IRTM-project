Starr made a surprise appearance at the O2 Arena on the last night of McCartney’s “Got Back” tour.
Announcing his special guest, McCartney said: “The one and only Mr. Ringo Starr!”
Walking onstage to rapturous applause, Starr embraced his former Beatle bandmate, before saying: “I want to tell you, I’ve had a great night tonight.”
Then McCartney, 82, turned to his 84-year-old friend and said: “Shall we rock?”
Much to the delight of the audience, the pair performed two of their famous tracks: “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” followed by “Helter Skelter.”

Ronnie Wood, member of rival ’60s band theRolling Stones, joined McCartney to play “Get Back.”
The two shared a hug before Wood left the stage, with McCartney saying: “Thank you, Ronald!”
In an interview with CNN last year, Starr said: “Paul called me the other day … We’re close, close friends. We’re brothers and you know, for me it was great because I’m an only child and suddenly I had three brothers that I could love, I could rely on, I could help out. You know, it was a great moment for me.”
